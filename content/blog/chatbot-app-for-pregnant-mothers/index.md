## Chatbot Mobile Applications for Pregnant Mothers

![Mountain](./image.jpg)

Hello readers, I'm going to introduce some chatbot mobile applications for pregnant mothers, which can be helpful for their daily activities.

There are many pregnancy tracker apps on the Google Play Store and the Apple Store. While pregnancy tracking apps can be fun and helpful, they are certainly no substitute for professional medical advice. Stork [1], a pregnancy tracker application available free for Android and iOS mobiles, allows users to input their due date to receive personalized updates each day and week their pregnancy progresses. Why should expecting moms get all the pregnancy app goodness? While there are a few dad-centric pregnancy apps out there, ProDaddy [2] is one of the highest-rated ones for a good reason. While some dad apps lean towards masculinizing parenthood with lumberjack imagery (lol), ProDaddy offers articles and tips that focus on equal parenting responsibility, like encouraging dads-to-be to get in on the baby shower, asking and using paternity leave, and more. 

Pregnancy + [3] is a popular app, offers a sleek and easy-to-navigate user interface. Pregnant mothers can track their baby’s kicks and their weight gain, as well as learn about their baby’s growth through size-specific illustrated charts and images from every angle through every week of their pregnancy. Pregnancy Tracker & Baby App [4] features specialized tips that correspond with how far pregnant mothers are in their pregnancy, like maternity shopping advice when they start to show. There is also a feature that allows them to talk to other expecting parents to exchange support and advice and just general excitement for their new bundles of joy. Pregnancy week by week by Amila [5], Pregnancy Tracker by Mobile Dimension LLC [6], and Pregnancy Tracker by What to Expect [7] are the actively used pregnancy care mobile applications in Play and the Apple Store. These applications are beneficial and valuable for the daily and weekly tracking of their pregnancy, and they have over one million downloads with average ratings of 4.7 to 4.9.

P-Bot (Pregnancy Chatbot) [8] is a chatbot that can answer questions related to pregnancy. P-Bot is a Ciscospark bot hosted in Heroku.com. This bot interacts with users by responding to questions related to pregnancy, such as general information, symptoms that may happen to the mom, baby development, and progress. MumCare [9], a mobile application to help pregnant mothers, provides an AI-based chatbot. This AI chatbot communicates and guides the mother to create the illusion of talking to their unborn child. However, none of these applications had the Voice User Interface (VUI) (voice-driven) to interact with the user. Therefore, we have developed an application will have a feature that can be helpful for pregnant mothers to interact through voice with the application in a friendly manner. I will breifly explain you about what is VUI applications and will introduce the application we have deloped for pregnant mothers in my next article.

Thank you for spending your time to have a look on this.
